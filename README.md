Repo for Fish Cake recipe

Ingredients
300g white fish fillets (cod, haddock, or pollock)
250g potatoes, peeled and chopped
1 egg
2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)
1 garlic clove, minced
1 spring onion, finely chopped
50g breadcrumbs (plus extra for coating)
Salt and black pepper, to taste
2 tbsp plain flour
2 tbsp oil (for frying)
Instructions
Cook the potatoes

Boil the potatoes in salted water until soft (about 10-15 minutes). Drain and mash until smooth. Let them cool slightly.
Cook the fish

Poach the fish in simmering water for about 5 minutes until cooked through. Drain, flake into small pieces, and remove any bones.
Mix the ingredients

In a bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, flaked fish, egg, parsley, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, spring onion, and breadcrumbs. Season with salt and pepper.
Mix well and shape into small patties (around 6-8 pieces).
Coat the fish cakes

Lightly coat each patty in flour, then dip in a little beaten egg, and finally coat with extra breadcrumbs for a crispy texture.
Fry the fish cakes

Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Cook the fish cakes for about 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy.
Serve

Serve hot with tartar sauce, a squeeze of lemon, or a fresh salad.
